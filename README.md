# GenericUseCase

Is a library that is a generic implementation of the Domain and Data layers in a clean architecture. 

# Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

# Motivation

As developers, we always need to deliver high quality software on time,
 which is not an easy task.
In most tasks, we need to make either a IO operation, whether from the server,
 db or file, which is a lot of boiler plate. And getting it write every time
 is a bit challenging due to the many things that you need to take care of. 
 Like separation of concerns, error handling and writing robust code that 
 would not crash on you.
 I have noticed that this code repeats almost with every user story, and 
 i was basically re-writing the same code, but for different models. So i 
 thought what if i could pass the class with the request and not repeat this
 code over and over. Hence, please welcome the GenericUseCase lib.
